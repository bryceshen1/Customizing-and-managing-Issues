# Step 1: Master basic search syntax
GitHub's issue search is powerful but only if you know how to use it. Let's learn the essential search operators.

## 📝 Core Search Operators
Search operators help you narrow down exactly what you're looking for:

- `is:issue` - Find only issues
- `is:open` or `is:closed` - Filter by status
- `repo:username/repository` - Search within a specific repository
- `label:bug` - Find issues with specific labels
- `assignee:username` - Find issues assigned to specific users
- `author:username` - Find issues created by specific users
- `mentions:username` - Find issues that mention specific users
- `milestone:"Version 1.0"` - Find issues within a specific milestone
- `created:>2023-01-01` - Find issues created after a certain date
- `updated:<2023-01-01` - Find issues updated before a certain date
- `no:assignee` - Find issues with no assignee
- `no:label` - Find issues with no labels
