## Step 2: Use Dynamic Filters to Navigate Issues Efficiently

GitHub offers powerful search capabilities directly in the Issues interface. You can use dynamic filters to quickly find and manage what matters most.

### 🧭 Navigating Filters

- Use dropdowns at the top of the Issues page (Labels, Milestones, Assignees, etc.) to build queries visually.
- Use keyboard shortcuts:  
  Press `/` on the Issues page to jump to the filter bar instantly.

### 📁 Optional: Organize Work with GitHub Projects

For a more visual and persistent workflow, consider setting up **GitHub Projects**:

- Create views like _"My Tasks"_, _"Recently Updated"_, or _"Needs Help"_
- Use built-in filters and grouping options
- Easily manage issues across multiple repositories

Comment "filters-created" when you've finished the tasks to move onto the next step!
