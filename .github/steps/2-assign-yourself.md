## Step 2: Use Dynamic Filters to Navigate Issues Efficiently

Instead of relying on saved searches, GitHub offers powerful search capabilities directly in the Issues interface. You can use dynamic filters to quickly find and manage what matters most.

### 🔍 Filtering Issues with Search Queries

You can filter issues using GitHub’s advanced search syntax. Simply click into the search bar on the Issues page and type your query. Here are some practical examples:

- **Recently updated issues**  
  `is:open is:issue sort:updated-desc`

- **Your assigned tasks in the current milestone**  
  `is:open is:issue assignee:@me milestone:current`

- **Open issues looking for contributors**  
  `is:open is:issue label:help-wanted`

### 🧭 Navigating Filters

- Use dropdowns at the top of the Issues page (Labels, Milestones, Assignees, etc.) to build queries visually.
- Use keyboard shortcuts:  
  Press `/` on the Issues page to jump to the filter bar instantly.

### 📁 Optional: Organize Work with GitHub Projects

For a more visual and persistent workflow, consider setting up **GitHub Projects**:

- Create views like _"My Tasks"_, _"Recently Updated"_, or _"Needs Help"_
- Use built-in filters and grouping options
- Easily manage issues across multiple repositories

Comment "filters-created" when you've finished the tasks to move onto the next step!
