# Step 3: Manage Issue subscriptions

Staying informed about Issues you care about is crucial for effective collaboration.

GitHub offers different ways to follow Issues:

- **Participating**: You'll be notified of any activity on Issues where you've participated
- **Watching**: You'll be notified of all activity on a repository
- **Custom**: You can subscribe to specific issues without watching the entire repository
